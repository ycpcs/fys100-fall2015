# Learning goals

* Experiment with basic waveforms
* Experiment with audio effects
* TODO: other stuff

# What to do

First, read the *What is sound?* section.

Next, do the experiments in the *Experiments* section.

## What is sound?

Sound is caused by rapid vibrations, or *oscillations*, in physical objects.  These oscillations cause rapid changes in air pressure over time.

Sounds can be characterized by the *rate* at which the oscillations occur.  For example, let's say that a vibration causes air pressure to increase and decrease at a rate of 440 changes per second: in other words, 440 times per second, the air pressure increases and then decreases.  We would describe this sound as having a *frequency* of 440 Hertz, abbreviated 440 Hz.

Sounds with lower frequencies sound "low", and sounds with higher frequencies sound "high".  The lowest frequency that we can hear is about 20 Hz, while the highest frequency we can hear is about 20,000 Hz.

The most fundamental kind of oscillation is the *sine wave*:

Sine waves tend to occur naturally due to the way physical objects vibrate.  A pure sine wave represents a single clear tone.  For example, here is a sample of a 440 Hz sine wave:

A sound consisting of a single sine wave tends to sound very artificial because sounds arising from the vibration of physical objects tend to have *overtones*, which are vibrations occuring at a multiple of the sound's base frequency.  For example, when an instrument string vibrates, the length of the string will determine the base frequency, but overtones will occur which are twice the base frequency, three times the base frequency, four times the base frequency, etc.

## Experiments

Yeah.
