title: "Lab 12: Ngrams"
---

# Learning goals

* Learn about interfaces for analyzing and visualizing data sets
* Learn about Google's Ngram Viewer
* Form a hypothesis about words/phrases and see if you can test it using Google's Ngram tool

# What to do

Think of some experiments you can do using the [Google Ngram viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams).  Since the underlying dataset used by the Ngram viewer is a huge collection of books published from the 1800s to the present, changes in the relative prevalence of words of phrases over time can allow us to learn interesting things about cultural trends.

You can use this lab as a way of getting started on [Unit Project 3](../project/project03.html), in which you will write up the results of one of your experiments.

As with [Lab 11](lab11.html), thinking of a good research question is the hard part.

To record your investigations, create a document called **Ngram experiments** in your shared Google Drive folder.
