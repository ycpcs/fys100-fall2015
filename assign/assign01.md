title: "Writing Assignment 1: Journal"
---

This assignment is ongoing throughout the semester.

# Learning goals

* Use written language to describe your experience at York College and in this course
* Reflect on the work you are doing, what you are learning, and how you are meeting the academic challenges you face

# What to do

Each week, you should be writing 2 or 3 entries in the journal you created in [Writing Assignment 0](assign00.html).  Make sure each entry is labeled with a date.  Each entry should consist of 1-3 paragraphs describing some combination of:

* What you are working on in this course (projects, assignments, etc.)
* Your experiences as a college student
* Challenges you have encountered, and how you have responded to them
* Anything else you think is interesting

# Grading

Each Monday, I will read your journal entries for the previous week, and mark your work as ✓ (satisfactorily completed) or ✗ (incomplete or unsatisfactory).  I may also add some comments and/or suggestions.
