**Due**: Thursday, Sep 4th 

# Learning goals

The motivation for this assignment is mainly practical: you will set up a Google Drive folder to use for the work you will do in the course, and create your journal document.  It will also give you some experience using Google Drive and Google Docs if you haven't used them before.

# What to do

## Step 1: Create a folder for your work

Log into [MyYCP](https://my.ycp.edu).  Click on the **Drive** icon.  It looks like this:

> ![Google Drive icon](img/drive.png)

Click on the **NEW** button (on the left hand side of the page), and choose **Folder**.

Enter "FYS-*Your full name*" as the name of the folder (substituting your name as appropriate.)  You should see a new folder appear.

Double-click on the folder.  Click on the sharing icon at the top of the page, which looks like this:

> ![Sharing icon](img/drive-share.png)

You should now see the **Share with others** dialog.  In the text box, enter **dhovemey@ycp.edu** as the email address, and make sure that **Can edit** is selected.  Then click **Done**.

By sharing the folder with me, I will be able to see your work, and also comment on it by adding my own edits.

## Step 2: Create your journal

Next, click the **NEW** button, and choose **Google Docs**.  A dialog titled "Create in shared folder" will appear.  Click **OK**: this will allow me to see the document and also edit it (so that I can add comments to it).  You should now see a new empty document.

Click on the document title in the upper left-hand corner of the browser (it will be *Untitled document* initially.)  Change the title to "FYS Journal-*Your name*".  This document will be your journal for the ongoing [Journal](assign01.html) writing assignment.

Finally, add a first journal entry.  It should look something like this:

> **September 1st, 2015**: I created a shared Google Drive folder for my FYS work, and started my journal.

Please feel free to add any additional thoughts you have about the course, what you hope to accomplish this semester, being in college, etc.
