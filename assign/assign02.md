# What to do

This writing assignment is a continuation of the discussion of the MELOMICS project, as we discussed in the [Music discussion day](../agenda/day16.html).

Your task is to write an essay arguing one of the following positions:

* Computers will never be able to compose music as well as human beings
* Computers cannot currently compose music as well as human beings, but someday they will
* Computers have reached the point where they can compose music as well as or better than human beings

Cite specific evidence supporting your position.  I would encourage you to use the reading/documentary/album from the music discussion day.  In addition, you are required to find *at least one additional source* to support your position.

Your essay must use [MLA format](https://www.library.cornell.edu/research/citation/mla) for sources.  Use citations as appropriate in your text when you refer to evidence in the sources you are using to support your argument.  Make sure that you have a list of works cited at the end of your essay.

Your essay should be *at least* two pages, not including the list of works cited.

Create your essay draft and final version as documents in your shared Google Drive folder.  The documents should be called **Writing Assignment 2 (draft)** and **Writing Assignment 2 (final)**, respectively.
