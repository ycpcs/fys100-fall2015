# Visual art

* Are people who write computer programs to create art (e.g., generative art) artists?

# Music

* Is electronically-produced music less authentic than music played by human performers using instruments?
* Can someone who creates electronic music using sequencers or a computer be considered a musician?
* Is it conceivable that a computer program could ever compose music as well as a human being? Could a computer program produce music that is *better* than a human?
