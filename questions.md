# Visual art

* Are people who write computer programs to create art (e.g., generative art) artists?
* Is visual art created on a computer less authentic than a physical drawing, painting, or print?
* If a computer can create convincing abstract art (like the algorithmically generated "Mondrian" in Noll67), does that mean that abstract art is less "artistic" than representational art?

# Music

* Is electronically-produced music less authentic than music played by human performers using instruments?
* Can someone who creates electronic music using sequencers or a computer be considered a musician?
* Is it conceivable that a computer program could ever compose music as well as a human being? Could a computer program produce music that is *better* than what could be composed by a human?
