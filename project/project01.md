*Update 9/29*: Changed due date for final version of reflection to **Friday, Oct 2nd**

# Deliverables / due dates

This project has the following deliverables:

* A program, due **Friday, Sept 25th** by 11:59 PM
* A reflection, draft due **Thursday, Sept 24th** by 11:59 PM, final version due **Friday, Oct 2nd**

The deliverables are described in the "What to do" section below.

# Learning goals

* Create a visual art composition using a Processing program
* Assess your composition critically
* Reflect on the process of creating your composition
* Write about your composition, expressing the ways in which your composition succeeded, and the ways in which it could be improved

# What to do

This section describes the two deliverables for the Project.

**Important**: Please create a folder called **Project 1** within your shared Google Drive folder (the one you created in [Writing Assignment 0](../assign/assign00.html)), and then create/upload your deliverables for this project in the **Project 1** folder.

## The program

Write a Processing program to create a visual art composition.  Your composition can be (and probably will be) a continuation of the work you did in [Lab 1](../labs/lab01.html), [Lab 2](../labs/lab02.html), [Lab 3](../labs/lab03.html), and [Lab 4](../labs/lab04.html).

Your composition may use any theme, but I respectfully ask you to avoid any image or theme that might be offensive.

Your composition *must* include:

* Static elements
* Repeated element or elements implemented in the program by using method(s) (as described in [Lab 2](../labs/lab02.html))

I also encourage you to use the following optional features in your composition:

* Repeated elements implemented using a loop (see [Lab 2](../labs/lab02.html))
* Generative elements such as fractals (see [Lab 3](../labs/lab03.html))
* Animated elements (see [Lab 4](../labs/lab04.html))

Be creative!  There is no right or wrong way to create art.  The important thing is to experiment.  Come up with ideas, try them out, see if they work, and repeat.

Submit your program by uploading it to your shared Google Drive folder.  Your program is a file that has a ".pde" file extension.  You can upload a file to a Google Drive folder by clicking **New**, choosing **File upload**, and then selecting the file you want to upload.

## The reflection

Your reflection should address the following topics.

*Introduction.*  How did you come up with the theme? What were you trying to achieve in creating your composition?

*Describe your creative process.*  What did you do to create your composition?   How did your composition evolve over time?  What were your experiences using a computer program to create visual art?  What aspects of the process were satisfying?  What aspects of the process were frustrating?

*In what ways did your composition succeed?*  What do you think worked out well in your composition?  How closely did the end product correspond to your original concept?

*In what ways do you think your composition could be improved?*  What aspects of the composition did not succeed in the way you had hoped?

*Conclusions.*  What did you learn from this experience?

Your reflection should be *at least* two pages in length.  (Two pages is a minimuim, and I would expect that it is more likely that three or more pages will be necessary.)  You should strive to be clear and concise.

Create your reflection documents using Google Docs in the shared **Project 1** folder (see above).  The reflection *draft* should be called **Relection (Draft)**.  The final version should be called **Reflection (Final)**.  You can create the final document by making a copy of the draft.

*Proofread your reflection carefully*.  I will make comments on the draft (so you can use the feedback for your final version), but it is your responsibility to check your work carefully for spelling and grammar errors.

# Grading

The overall project is worth 100 points.

The program is worth up to 40 points, and the reflection up to 60.

For the program:

* A basic composition (with a small number of visual elements, but with at least one repeated element implemented using a method) will earn up to 28 points
* A more complex composition (with a larger number of visual elements, and also with at least one repeated element implemented using a method) will earn up to 32 points
* Up to 8 points may be earned through the use of optional features (repeated elements using a loop, generative elements, and/or animated elements)

For the reflection:

* Introduction: up to 5 points
* Discussion of creative process: up to 15 points
* Discussion of ways in which the composition succeeded: up to 15 points
* Discussion of ways in which the composition could be improved: up to 15 points
* Conclusions: up to 5 points

To earn a higher grade for the reflection, you should express yourself clearly and concisely, and your writing should offer some deep insights into the creative process.
