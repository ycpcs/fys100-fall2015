# Deliverables / due dates

The only deliverable is an essay.  Submit this by creating a document called **Project 4 Essay** in your shared Google Drive folder.

The essay should be about 2 pages long, and address the topics described in the *What to do* section below.

Submit your essay by the end of day on **Tuesday, Dec 15th**.  Note that there is no draft for this assignment: the only submission is for the final version.

# Learning goals

* Reflect on applications for embedded controllers

# What to do

In [Lab 15](../labs/lab15.html), we experimented with using an Arduino with an RGB color sensor to detect colors and display the color names on an LCD display.

In your essay, address the following topics:

* What "real-life" applications can you think of for the Arduino and RGB color sensor?  Note that embedded controllers can be used to control *actuators* such as motors, valves, switches, etc., effectively allowing the embedded controller to act as the "brains" of a larger system.  Think of one real-life application for the Arduino and color sensor and describe it in detail.
* What other real life applications can you think of for embedded controllers?  In particular, think about how an embedded controller might be useful for visual art, the performing arts, agriculture, and other areas not usually associated with computing technology.  Think of at least one such application and describe it in detail.
* Finally, do you think knowledge of programming and designing systems with embedded controllers is something that everyone should know?  For example, do you think it should be taught in schools?  Briefly discuss your position and state some reasons.
