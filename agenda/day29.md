Mason, appearing in MIS Quarterly, Volume 10, Number 1, 1986.

As you read the article, think about the following discussion questions:

* This article was published in 1986.  Do you think the article's characterization of the ethical issues in a digital society is still accurate, almost 30 years later?  Did the article miss anything that is an issue now?
* What do you think are the greatest benefits of living in a society where information is so widely available?
* What do you think are the greatest dangers of living in a society where information is so widely available?
* What do you think we can do as members of a digital society to help ensure that information is used in a responsible and ethical way?

Save your answers to these questions in a document called **Ethical issues responses** in your shared Google Drive folder.
