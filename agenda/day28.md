# Agenda

Day 28 is the science unit discussion day.  We will have presentations on [Lab 14](../labs/lab14.html) and [Lab 15](../labs/lab15.html).  A lab 14 presentations should demonstrate something interesting you found: for example, a combination of parameters that produced an interesting effect in the simulation.  A Lab 15 presentation should discuss what technique you used to classify colors, and how effective it was.
