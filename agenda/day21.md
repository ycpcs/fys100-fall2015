Based on your experiences working on [Lab 13](../labs/lab13.html), think about the following discussion questions:

* Google Maps enables us to "virtually" visit other places.  How authentic is visiting a place using Google Maps compared to actually being there physically?
* What can you learn about literature, history, etc. through Google Maps?
* Do you think tools like Google Maps enable us to learn things about literature and history that wouldn't be possible otherwise?  If so, what?  If not, why not?
* What are the limitations of Google Maps for studying literature, history, etc.?  Do you think these limitations can be overcome in the future as tools like Google Maps become more powerful?  What features do you think Google Maps should have in order to be more useful?
