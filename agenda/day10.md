# Agenda

On day 10 we will work on [Lab 6](../labs/lab10.html), in which we will create a rhythm part for a music composition.

## Get Ready

You will need a USB flash drive with *at least* 2 GB of space on it.

Download the file **soundfonts.zip** from the following link:

> <https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz83qbgNYuDXdjI3d1BWQ0liRkU>

Note that you will need to be logged into your YCP Google account for this download to work.  (I.e., log into mail or Google drive before you try the download.)  This is a very large file (about 900 MB in size.)

Once the download has completed, extract the zipfile onto your flash drive.  You should see a folder called **SoundFonts** on the flash drive.  This folder contains a number of soundfonts containing instrument sounds that you can use in your music composition in Lab 6 and subsequent labs.

Once you have the **SoundFonts** folder on your flash drive, you can delete **soundfonts.zip**.
