# Agenda

On day 12 we will work on [Lab 9](../labs/lab09.html).

## Get Ready

Lab 9 involves creating "random" music, so it is not a direct continuation of the composition you've been working on.  However, you might generate some figures in Lab 9 that you will want to incorporate into your composition.
