# Agenda

On day 14 we will work on [Lab 10](../labs/lab10.html).

## Get Ready

Your task to get ready is to find some *samples*: short audio clips that you can play back as part of your composition.  One very good place to find samples is [freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org/).

Make sure that your samples have a sample rate of 44.1 KHz (which is 41,000 Hz).  Both mono and stereo samples are fine.

Put your samples in a **Samples** folder on the flash drive you have your soundfonts on.
