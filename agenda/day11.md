# Agenda

On day 11 we will work on [Lab 7](../labs/lab07.html), in which we will work on adding melodic parts to our music compositions.

## Get Ready

It wouldn't be a bad idea to review the FunWithSound documentation (as described in the [Day 9](day09.html) agenda.)

This is unrelated to the lab, but please read the [First Year Experience Events (pdf)](../media/YCP First-Year Experience Events Fall 2015.pdf) and [Additional Campus Events (pdf)](../media/Additional Campus Events of Interest to FYS Students Fall 2015.pdf) documents and think about which event(s) you would be interested in attending.  There will be a writing assignment involving attending an event and writing about it (coming soon).
