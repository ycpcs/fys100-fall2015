# Agenda

On day 3 we will use Processing to create a visual image.  Before you come to class, think about what image you would like to create.  Your image should consist of simple geometric shapes, so it should be fairly abstract.

*A request*: please make your image G-rated, and avoid including anything that might be considered offensive.  Thank you.

## Get ready

<img class="parimg" alt="Get ready" src="img/getready.png">

Using graph paper, draw a sketch of your image.  Your sketch should consist of simple geometric shapes, such as rectangles, ellipses, triangles, etc.  In [Lab 1](../labs/lab01.html), which we will work on in class, you will translate your sketch into Processing code.
